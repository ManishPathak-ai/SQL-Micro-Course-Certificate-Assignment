# SQL-Micro-Course-Certificate-Assignment
Iâ€™m excited to share that Iâ€™ve recently completed an SQL assignment provided by Satish Dhawale, Founder of Skill Course. In this assignment, I worked on a hospital dataset and extracted key insights using SQL queries.
âœ… Total patients and doctors statistics
 âœ… Top-performing departments
 âœ… Hospitals with maximum medical expenses
 âœ… Length of stay analysis
 âœ… Monthly medical expense trends
This hands-on experience helped me strengthen my data analysis skills and apply SQL to real-world-style datasets.
ðŸ“„ Iâ€™m also sharing the PDF of my assignment solution here for anyone whoâ€™s curious to explore the queries and results.
